# Asteroids

Asteroids is a two-dimensional vector shooter. You control your spaceship, dodging and destroying an endless supply of asteroids.

When you start the game, your spaceship will be in the middle of the screen and then a few asteroids will appear on the screen.

Your job is to blast those rocks. However, when you blast them, they break up into 2 medium rocks. Blasting a medium rock gives you 2 small rocks. In addition, you have to contend with large and small saucers.
